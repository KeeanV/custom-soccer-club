# Fantasy Soccer Application  




**I chose this project because I am interested in soccer, fantasy soccer, and
the applications of statistical analysis to soccer**

What will the application do?

**The application will have a list of teams, with each team
containing a list of players. Each player will have a record of
their statistics (goals, assists, clean sheets)
and a calculation to assign them a number of points 
based on their statistics. That total number of points is assigned
to the user, who can then compare their points total to their friends
or whoever they are competing with.**

Who will use it?

**The application will be used by anyone who wants to play fantasy soccer
whether on their own or if they are competing for the highest score
with a group of people.**
